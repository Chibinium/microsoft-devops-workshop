# Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

Kubernetes has additional primitives which are specific to RBAC, and have been GA since version 1.8. 

#### Role
A Role can only be used to grant access to resources within a single namespace.

```
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```

#### ClusterRole
A ClusterRole can be used to grant the same permissions as a Role, but they are cluster-scoped can grant access to:
- cluster-scoped resources (like nodes)
- non-resource endpoints (like “/healthz”)
- namespaced resources (like pods) across all namespaces (needed to run kubectl get pods --all-namespaces, for example)

```
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  # "namespace" omitted since ClusterRoles are not namespaced
  name: secret-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["secrets"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```

#### RoleBinding
A RoleBinding may reference a Role in the same namespace. The following RoleBinding grants the “pod-reader” role to the user “jane” within the “default” namespace. This allows “jane” to read pods in the “default” namespace.

```
# This role binding allows "jane" to read pods in the "default" namespace.
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: jane # Name is case sensitive
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role #this must be Role or ClusterRole
  name: pod-reader # this must match the name of the Role or ClusterRole you wish to bind to
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

A RoleBinding may also reference a ClusterRole to grant the permissions to namespaced resources defined in the ClusterRole within the RoleBinding’s namespace.

```
# This role binding allows "dave" to read secrets in the "development" namespace.
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: read-secrets
  namespace: development # This only grants permissions within the "development" namespace.
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: dave # Name is case sensitive
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: secret-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

#### ClusterRoleBinding
A ClusterRoleBinding may be used to grant permission at the cluster level and in all namespaces.

```
# This cluster role binding allows anyone in the "manager" group to read secrets in any namespace.
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: read-secrets-global
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: manager # Name is case sensitive
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: secret-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

#### ServiceAccount
Service accounts can replace "User" in the `subjects` section of each role binding. These are also defined as yaml, and are generally used to allow pods to make API calls, from wtihin the cluster.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: build-deployment-robot
automountServiceAccountToken: false
```
